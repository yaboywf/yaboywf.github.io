While this showed motivation, it also made execution challenging at the start. Through facilitator guidance, I learned the importance of translating intentions into clear, actionable steps.

What worked well was maintaining discipline and adapting my routine when necessary. One example of adaptation was my decision to move away from using Simply Piano as the main learning tool, as I realised it was becoming too easy and no longer sufficiently challenging. Instead, I shifted towards learning through YouTube tutorials, which required greater independence and active listening. This change better supported skill development and encouraged deeper engagement with the learning process. However, not all aspects progressed evenly, as some areas required more focused attention than I initially allocated. This highlighted the need for flexibility in execution. By adjusting my approach mid-semester, I became more aware of how different tasks demanded different levels of time and effort.",e("br",{}),e("br",{}),"The monitoring phase was critical in identifying gaps that were not immediately obvious to me. Facilitator feedback helped me recognise that completion alone was insufficient without clear explanation and evidence of learning.

This phase reinforced the importance of reviewing work critically rather than assuming it meets expectations.",e("br",{}),e("br",{}),"Finally, the reflection phase allowed me to consolidate my learning across the semester. Looking back, what went well was my willingness to accept feedback and make improvements iteratively. What did not go as well was my initial tendency to underestimate the depth required in reflection and documentation. This occurred because I focused more on doing than analysing. Moving forward, I will place greater emphasis on reflective thinking, ensuring that my actions, challenges, and improvements are clearly articulated and supported by evidence.
