                <br><br>
                Dylan excels in Principles of Account and Mathematics. This was shown in his good performance in the End-Of-Year Examination (2022) for both subjects. He actively participated in Mathematics lessons by asking questions to clarify his doubts.

                <br><br>
                Dylan possesses a blend of humility and capability, allowing him to make significant contributions to the school.
                He stands as a shining example of the power of quiet determination and unwavering commitment. He will be an asset to any organization he joins inÂ future.
