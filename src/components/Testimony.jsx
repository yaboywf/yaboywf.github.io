            <h2>Write-up from PolyTechnic</h2>

            <article>
                Dylan is academically and technically astute. He has attained outstanding results in his first year at TP, earning him a place in the Director’s List which is reserved for the top 10% of students. He attained a cumulative grade point average of 4.0 (out of a mx of 4 points) and achieved Distinctions in the following subjects: Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Network and Cloud Technology, Database Application Development, Application Development Project.
                <br /><br />
                Dylan is quick to learn things and has a keen interest in emerging technologies. His passion for IT began early, sparked by a free coding course with Saturday Kids. That experience inspired him to explore how technology works and how it can be used to improve lives. Since then, he has consistently sought out opportunities to grow his skills and apply them meaningfully.
                <br /><br />
                He is currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology at Temasek Polytechnic, and approaches his education with enthusiasm, both in and out of the classroom. He participated in the PolyFinTech100 API Hackathon 2024 and is now training for the NUS HumanITy Challenge — both platforms where he has put his technical skills to practical use.
                <br /><br />
                Beyond academics, Dylan is a leader who is passionate about using tech to help others. He volunteers with The Boys’ Brigade 21st Singapore Company, where he helps improve their administrative website, and is preparing to teach Python to members of The Girls’ Brigade 2nd Company. He has also conducted tech workshops with the Singapore Computer Society, teaching Microsoft Excel and Canva to their beneficiaries.
                <br /><br />
                Dylan is an active member of the Informatics and IT Studies Club sub-committee and a recipient of The Boys’ Brigade Founders’ Award — the highest honour in the Seniors’ Programme. He balances his commitments with ease and stays grounded through regular badminton games with family and friends.
                <br /><br />
                Given his strong intellectual acumen, drive, and commitment to learning and excelling, Dylan is well-positioned to be a most worth candidate. We are confident that he will excel and contribute in very positive ways.
